NPT Monte Carlo simulation conditions
N = 2048
P' = 0.14 (reduced units)
T' = 0.71 (reduced units)
P = 4.866 MPa
T = 85.058 K

Final box size = 13.4622 (reduced units)*

final_state.pdb: structure file (plain text) with the atom information and coordinates for the final state
trajectory.dcd:  binary file with the coordinates for the trajectory
box_size.txt:    plain text file documenting the box size for each frame in trajectory.dcd

*ATTENTION: Note that the coordinates in final_state.pdb and trajectory.dcd are in reduced units.  To convert these to Angstroms, multiply by 3.405.
